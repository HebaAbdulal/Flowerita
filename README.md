## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

           
    - Present on every page, the fully responsive navigation bar features links to the Home page, Inspiration, About us, Contact us and Order page. It remains consistent across all pages, ensuring effortless navigation.
                
    - This feature enables users to seamlessly move between pages on any device without needing to rely on the "back" button.
                
    - On mobile devices, the navigation links transform into a burger toggler. This change was made to enhance the site's aesthetics and ensure a favorable user experience, as the burger icon is commonly associated with mobile navigation, promoting ease of use for visitors.
